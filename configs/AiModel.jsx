Make sure to add Python to your system\'s PATH during installation so you can run Python from your terminal or command prompt.\\n3. **Verify Installation:** Open your terminal or command prompt and type `python --version` or `python3 --version` (depending on your installation). A version number should be displayed, confirming successful installation.\\n4. **Choosing an IDE or Text Editor:** An Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like VS Code, PyCharm, or Thonny provides features like code completion, debugging, and integrated terminal.
